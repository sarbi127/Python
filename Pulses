#Assignment A1 - “Pulses”

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Question 1

#manually split each row on commas.

with open('pulses.csv', 'r') as f:
    readCSV = []
    for line in f:
        words = line.split(',')
        readCSV.append((words[0:]))
    print(readCSV)

#Create a list for all the timestamps in column 1.

    timestamps = []
    for lines in readCSV:
       timestamp = lines[0]
       timestamps.append(timestamp)

#Create a list of lists for the detector readings - you can access elements with
#foo[1][4]

    foo = list(readCSV)
    #print(foo)
    print(foo[1][4])

# Question 2

#1. Modify your code for Question 1, so that the readings are converted back to voltages,
#according to this formula (the ** means “raised to the power of” in Python):
#Voltage (Volts) = (ADC Reading) / (2**10 - 1) * 0.6

    for i in range(len(foo)):
        for j in range(len(foo[i])):
            vol = (j) / (2**10 - 1) * 0.6
            print('vol=', vol)

#2. Refactor the code so that this conversion (for a single value) is in a separate function,
#name it appropriately.
#3. Specify the conversion parameter as a constant at the top of your code. (In Python, we
#put constants in UPPER_CASE by convention).

    for i in range(len(data)):
        for j in range(len(data[i])):
            vol = (j) / ( R_POWER -1 ) * 0.6
            print('vol =', vol)

vol_function(foo)

# Question 3

#1. Plot a single pulse (i.e. row of the CSV file).
#2. Add axis labels, and a title.
#3. Save the figure to disk using .savefig(..)

x = []
y = []

for row in readCSV:
    x.append(int(row[0]))

plt.plot(x, label=' A single pulse')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.title('Loaded from pulses')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
plt.savefig('fig.png')

# Question 4

#1. Build a new list of lists.
#2. For each row/pulse:
#a. find the mean (average) of the first 10 elements.
#b. Use a for loop to subtract this value from all values in that row.

      sub =0
      for k in range(len(foo[i])):
          sub = k - mean
          print('sub=', sub)

#3. Refactor this code into its own function (for a row), and name it accordingly.
#4. Use a constant for 10.
